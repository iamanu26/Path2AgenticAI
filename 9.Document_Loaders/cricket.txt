The Song of Cricket

On fields where morning mist still sleeps,
And sunlight slowly, softly creeps,
Where dew still clings to blades of green,
A silent stage awaits the scene.

The pitch lies calm, the crowd not loud,
Yet dreams already float in cloud;
For cricket is not just a game,
It is a fire, a living flame.

A leather ball, a willow blade,
A battle timelessly replayed;
Between the bowler’s fierce intent
And batter’s calm, unbending stance bent.

The umpire stands in patient grace,
Watching each move, each pace, each face;
While fielders wait like hunters still,
Eyes locked upon the striker’s will.

The bowler runs, the rhythm tight,
Steps pounding earth with growing might;
His arm whips round, the ball takes flight,
A blur of red in morning light.

It swings, it seams, it dips, it darts,
A test of nerves, a clash of hearts;
The batter moves in measured art,
Bat meets ball—crowds erupt, depart
From silence into roaring cheer,
A boundary struck, the message clear.

Cricket is patience carved in play,
Where heroes rise through long delay;
Hours pass beneath the sun,
Victory earned, not quickly won.

Some days belong to bowlers bold,
Who spin their magic, brave and cold;
A turning ball, a looping tease,
Beats bat and mind with gentle ease.

The stumps are shattered, bails take flight,
The crowd explodes in wild delight;
A wicket falls, momentum swings,
And hope grows fresh on unseen wings.

Fielders dive on dusty ground,
Chasing glory without a sound;
A single catch, held in the air,
Can change the match beyond repair.

Test matches stretch through passing days,
A marathon of mind and ways;
Five sunsets witness grit and fight,
From morning hope to fading light.

White clothes stained by effort pure,
Sweat and struggle they endure;
A draw, a win, or loss may be,
But courage writes the memory.

Then comes the roar of colored night,
Floodlights burning crisp and bright;
Crowds dance loud in T20 thrill,
Where boundaries fall by daring will.

Batters swing with fearless aim,
Turning pressure into flame;
Sixes soaring into skies,
While tension in each heartbeat lies.

Last over, six runs still to make,
Every breath the crowd must take;
The bowler stares, the batter waits,
Fate itself anticipates.

Ball flies high beyond the rope,
A nation screams in bursting hope;
Strangers hug in shared delight,
United in that single night.

Cricket lives in gullies small,
Where broken windows bear the call;
Tennis balls and chalk-drawn crease,
Where laughter never seems to cease.

Children dream with borrowed bat,
Pretending crowds cheer them like that;
Imaginary finals won,
Before their real journey’s begun.

Every street holds hidden stars,
Future legends born in scars;
Of scraped knees, missed shots, endless tries,
And dreams reflected in young eyes.

Cricket teaches fall and rise,
Patience under scorching skies;
That defeat today may sow
The strength tomorrow’s wins will show.

A captain learns in pressure’s heat,
When to attack, when to retreat;
Strategy carved in seconds brief,
Balancing risk with calm belief.

Old fans recall heroic days,
Historic matches, timeless plays;
Stories passed from age to age,
Living legends on memory’s page.

Cricket is tea breaks shared in peace,
Radio commentaries that never cease;
Families gathered around a screen,
Celebrating moments unseen.

It is heartbreak too, when hopes collapse,
A dropped catch, or fortune snaps;
Yet fans return with loyal cheer,
Season after season, year by year.

Because cricket mirrors life’s own art—
Joy and pain, loss and start;
A game where character is tried,
Where courage cannot simply hide.

The final ball, the final run,
A match, a series, tournament won;
But deeper still, beyond the score,
Are memories that forever soar.

So when you hear the stadium roar,
Or leather thud on bat once more,
Know you witness more than play—
You see a timeless tale at sway.

For cricket lives in every heart
Where passion dares to make a start;
A simple game, yet vast and deep—
A promise that the world will keep.

And somewhere now, on some small ground,
A child swings bat without a sound,
Dreaming crowds chant out his name,
Falling in love with cricket’s flame
